# DevDataProd_FinalProject

This is the final project for the Developing Data Products module whereby I 
created a shiny application to calculate and graph 3 different Break-Even points
based on user inputs.

The final application is hosted on shinyapps.io platform. All files are on GitHub under this repository.
