Break-Even Analysis
========================================================

Break-even analysis lets you determine the level of sales (in units or revenue) needed to cover all associated cost. A project breaks even when Total Cost equals Total Revenue. Any additional revenue generated beyond that point is pure profit to the company.

Types of Break-Even Point
========================================================

There are 3 different break-even points:  
- Accounting Break-even: level at which total fixed costs (including depreciation) equal revenues.    
- Cash Break-even:level at which total fixed costs (excluding depreciation) equal revenues.   
- Financial Break-even: is the level of EBIT required to pay off interest, dividends, and taxes.

Break-Even Point Calculation
========================================================

This application will calculate all three different breakeven points and provide a visual representation of the result.

The user inputs a set of variables such as the required return, the investment, unit price, expected unit sales and all fixed and variable costs.  

If taxes are relevant to the project, then use the slider to select your tax rate as well as the life of the project.

The Break-Even Analysis application will automatically calculate the Accounting, Cash, and Finacial Break-even oints in units of sales.
